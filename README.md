## What is BashDB? <a name="intro"></a>

BashDB aims to be a simple state manager for bash scripts. Rather than simply writing to individual files per script, this aims to provides a consolidated key-value store that is also faster than writing to disk. Furthermore, BashDB supports concurrency, in-memory caching, and aggressive data compression (via zlib).
